# Heat transfer model for sewer pipe - Malmö case-study
This repo contains the code used to model heat transfer for sewer pipes. 
The model is used for a case-study in Malmö.

<strong>Steps to run the model</strong>
1. mexall - This will mex the c-files that will be used in the simulation
2. run_sewermodel_malmo_mechanistic - This will run the mechanistic model
3. run_sewermodel_malmo_conceptual - This will run the conceptual model
4. malmo_runall - This will run both the mechanistic and conceptual model
